    <p>
        <span class="sc">Elina G. Hamilton</span> joined the Conservatory in 2014 and
        is an instructor of music history.

        Hamilton is a musicologist who specializes in the history
        of music theory in the Middle Ages. Her doctoral research
        examined the intellectual context of English music theory in the
        <span class="sc">fourteenth century</span>
        and has been presented at numerous institutions, including Oxford University,
        Princeton University, Charles University (Prague), <span class="sc">MIT</span>,
        and Yale. Her research has been published in leading journals and edited volumes,
        including Musica Disciplina.
</p>
<p>
        Aside from her interest in music of the distant past, Hamilton is an
        avid supporter of the performance of new music: she has performed with
        the London-based vocal ensemble Vocal Constructivists and held the
        position of festival manager for the <span class="sc">Bangor</span>
        New Music Festival in Bangor,
        Wales. Hamilton’s teaching interests span a variety of topics, including
        the history of music theory, early music history, the piano repertoire
        of Frédéric Chopin, and music of Bohemia.
