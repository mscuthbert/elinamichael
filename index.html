    <h2>Elina's <span class="orange">Story</span></h2>
    <p>
        <span class="sc">Elina G. Hamilton</span>'s maternal grandparents 
        moved to Japan in the 1950s as missionaries. 
        Her grandmother, Eleanor, was one of the first to teach at the
        Yokohama International School and raised three daughters in the 
        Yokohama region.
    </p> 
    <p>
        Her mother, Ronaele, inspired no doubt by her own mother's teaching,
        studied to become a teacher herself. After completeing college,
        she returned to Japan where she taught elementary school at a language 
        school in Karuizawa. It was here where her mother met her father, 
        Daniel, who was learning Japanese. They were married in Karuizawa in 1983.
    </p>
    <p>
        Their first-born daughter, Elina grew up in the mountains of <span class="sc">Nagano</span>. 
        She attended Japanese School and learned to love the beauty of this
        culture deeply. She won many school awards for her Japanese calligraphy
        and often came home with perfect scores on her Kanji tests. Spelling, 
        on the other hand, was a little less successful. 
    </p>
    <p>
        At a young age, she learned to play the <span class="sc">piano</span>  and by the age of 14,
        she spent most of her spare hours in front of her instrument.
        Her siblings will remember how she would be too busy to play with them
        because "she needed to practice." 
    </p>
    <p>
        Alongside her music making, she spent many happy hours working at 
        <span class="sc">café Cembalo</span> where she learned the culinary skills of French cooking.
        Food prepared with their natural and authentic flavors is still something
        she enjoys thinking through when cooking a good meal.
    </p>
    <p>
        Deciding to study music in college, she moved to beautiful <span class="sc">Portland, OR</span>
        where she received her Bachelor of Music degree in piano performance.
        It was not long before she knew that four years of education would be 
        too short for acquiring the knowledge she desired. 
    </p>
    <p>
        To attend graduate school, she moved to Wales where, after completing her
        master's degree, she was awarded a scholarship to pursue her Ph.D.
        in <span class="sc">medieval music theory</span>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        She is currently Assistant Professor at the Boston Conservatory at Berklee.
        
    </p>
    <h2>私の<span class="orange">ストーリー</span></h2>
    <p>
        <span class="sc">Michael Scott Cuthbert</span>, Associate Professor of Music
        (AB ’98, AM ’01, Ph. D. ’06, Harvard University) is a musicologist who
        has worked extensively on music of the <span class="sc">fourteenth-century</span>, computational musicology, and minimalism and other music of the past forty years. His publications include seven articles on computational musicology, Ars Nova: French and Italian Music of the Fourteenth Century (with John Nádas), “Generalized Set Analysis and Sub-Saharan African Rhythm,” and “Free Improvisation: John Zorn and the Construction of Jewish Identity through Music.” Cuthbert’s current book project, Ars Mutandi, covers sacred music in Italy during the Black Death and Great Schism.
