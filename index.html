        <h2>Elina’s <span class="orange">Story</span></h2>
        <p>
            <span class="sc">Elina G. Hamilton</span>'s maternal grandparents
            moved to Japan in the <span class="scNoBold"><span class="scNum">1950</span></span>s as missionaries.
            Her grandmother, <span class="sc">Eleanor</span>, was one of the first to teach at the
            Yokohama International School and raised three daughters in the
            Yokohama region.
        </p>
        <p>
            Her mother, <span class="sc">Ronaele</span>, inspired no doubt by her own mother's teaching,
            studied to become a teacher herself. After completeing college,
            she returned to Japan where she taught elementary school at a language
            school in Karuizawa. It was here where her mother met her father,
            <span class="sc">Daniel</span>, who was learning Japanese. They were married in Karuizawa in
            <span class="scNoBold"><span class="scNum">1983</span></span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Their first-born daughter, Elina grew up in the mountains of <span class="sc">Nagano</span>.
            She attended Japanese School and learned to love the beauty of this
            culture deeply. She won many school awards for her Japanese calligraphy
            and often came home with perfect scores on her Kanji tests. Spelling,
            on the other hand, was a little less successful.
        </p>
        <p>
            At a young age, she learned to play the <span class="sc">piano</span>
            and by the age of <span class="scNoBold"><span class="scNum">14</span></span>.
            she spent most of her spare hours in front of her instrument.
            Her siblings will remember how she would be too busy to play with them
            because "she needed to practice."
        </p>
        <p>
            Alongside her music making, she spent many happy hours working at
            <span class="sc"><a href="http://www.bourgo.jp/event/chenbaro.html">café Cembalo</a></span>
            where she learned the culinary skills of French cooking.
            Food prepared with their natural and authentic flavors is still something
            she enjoys thinking through when cooking a good meal.
        </p>
        <p>
            Deciding to study music in college, she moved to beautiful <span class="sc">Portland, OR</span>
            where she received her Bachelor of Music degree in piano performance.
            It was not long before she knew that four years of education would be
            too short for acquiring the knowledge she desired.
        </p>
        <p>
            To attend graduate school, she moved to Wales where, after completing her
            master’s degree, she was awarded a scholarship to pursue her Ph.D.
            in <span class="sc">medieval music theory</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            She is currently Assistant Professor at the Boston Conservatory at Berklee.

    <div class="row col-md-11 col-md-offset-1">
        <h2>Michael’s <span class="orange">Story</span></h2>
        <p>
            <span class="sc">Michael Scott Cuthbert</span> grew up in
            <span class="sc">Escondido</span> in the suburbs of San Diego, California.
            His parents, <span class="sc">David</span> and <span class="sc">Kimiko</span>
            met in <span class="sc">Okinawa</span>
            where Kimiko was a nurse and and David was in the <span class="sc">U.S. Navy</span>
            during the vietnam war.  They were married in
            <span class="scNoBold"><span class="scNum">1971</span></span> and happily
            raised a family and built a home together until his mother's untimely
            death in <span class="scNoBold"><span class="scNum">2015</span></span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Being naturally unable to walk in a straight line, Michael was encouraged
            by his mom to join marching band in jr. high, where he chose to play the clarinet (to meet girls).
            Music stuck with him: he attended <span class="sc">Harvard</span> intending not to
            continue in music, but eventually gave in and ended up staying for twelve years
            to do a Ph.D. in <span class="sc">medieval italian music</span>.  His choice of
            research topics forced him to endure many a summer and two full years traveling through
            the hills of tuscany, riding a vespa in the streets of rome, and suffering
            many long italian meals with dear friends.
        </p>
        <p>
            During school
            he paid his bills by being a computer programmer, a skill he picked up by being
            jealous of his older brother's ability to do so, and he's managed to combine a love
            of music and a love of computers in his work.
        </p>
        <p>
            After graduating, he stayed in the area to teach, and over the course of a
            “temporary” twenty-three year sojourn in <span class="sc">Boston</span>,
            he's learned to appreciate the autumn, tolerate the snow, ignore the traffic,
            and adjust his sleep schedule to still watch the <span class="scNoBold">Padres</span> lose.
        </p>
        <p>
            he is currently Associate Professor of Music
            and director of digital humanities at <span class="sc">MIT</span>.

    <div class="row col-md-11 col-md-offset-1">
        <h2>Our <span class="orange">Story</span></h2>
        <p>
            in <span class="sc"><span class="scNum">2009</span></span> at a conference on Medieval
            and Renaissance music in <span class="sc">Utrecht, Netherlands</span>,
            a mutual friend alerted Michael that there was a first-time attendee who spoke fluent
            <span class="sc">Japanese</span> and was beautiful.  Elina recalls being approached by a dashing professor
            who warmly welcomed her into the field...perhaps overly friendly?
        </p>
        <p>
            The next summer they ended up
            secluded together in northern Italy at Neustift&mdash;the “New Monastery,”
            which will soon celebrate its <span class="scNoBold"><span class="scNum">900</span>th</span>
            birthday.  Over the course of a week of hearing papers, drinking wine,
            and bathing in the monastic pool together, their <span class="sc">friendship</span> deepened knowing that
            such conference encounters would continue the rest of their lives. (When Michael said that,
            it did creep Elina out a bit).
        </p>
        <p>
            They kept running into each other, giving papers
            at conferences in Barcelona, Princeton, Certaldo in central Italy, and Southampton in England.
            Each time the hours of <span class="sc">conversation</span> lengthened, the
            number of glasses of <span class="sc">wine</span> increased, and the
            parting <span class="sc">hug</span> lasted just a bit longer than the time before.
            Between conferences,
            <span class="sc">Facebook</span> allowed them to stay in touch
            (and to spy on each other),
            despite the <span class="scNoBold"><span class="scNum">3000</span> miles</span> separating them.
        </p>
        <p>
            In <span class="sc"><span class="scNum">2013</span></span> Elina gave a talk at
            <span class="scNoBold">MIT</span>. While she was in Boston they took a lengthy bike ride along the Charles River,
            had hot chocolate at the Frog Pond on the Common, and finally came to realize that
            text messages and Facebook likes weren't going to be enough for them.
        </p>
        <p>
            Michael came to Wales that <span class="sc">New Years Eve</span> and together he and Elina
            packed up her belongings
            to move to be together in Boston.  <span class="sc">Trips</span> together over the next
            three years to Brussels, Vancouver, West Virigina, Prague,
            the Grand Canyon, and finally Japan,
            along with daily meals together, bad movies, and an ever-intertwining web of dear <span class="sc">friends</span>,
            made them realize they wanted to share the rest of their lives together.
</p>
<p>
            Over sushi and sake,
            <span class="sc">Michael</span> proposed on <span class="sc">Elina</span>’s <span class="scNoBold"><span class="scNum">33</span>rd</span>
            birthday, and she said <span class="sc">yes</span>.

            <p>
                We are <span class="sc">honored</span> that you are part of our lives and your
                attendance and/or <span class="sc">best wishes</span> are all the gifts we need to
                begin our lives together.  We also realize that getting to Boston and staying
                there for a weekend can put a strain on any budget; therefore we hope that no
                one will feel any obligation to give any gift except their <span class="sc">love</span>
                on this occasion.
            </p>
            <p>
                We do, however, know that the thoughtfulness you have given us in our lives
                does sometimes extend to wishing to offer a tangible token at this moment.
                As our house, like many Boston houses, is very small (<span class="scNoBold">1,000 sq. ft.</span>), we greatly
                appreciate physically small items that have many uses or can be consumed.
                We have created a list of some gifts we could use immediately below:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/wedding/elina-hamilton-michael-cuthbert-cambridge-september-2018/registry/1Y4NTYMXQ63OO" target=_new>Amazon</a>

                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                We also recognize that not everyone is as lucky as we are and if you were
                moved instead to support one of these local charities, it would be as
                great an honor as if we received the support ourselves:
            </p>
